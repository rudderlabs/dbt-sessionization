The first intent is to be able to link all events from the same user via some common identifier. Rudder data payload contains two fields anonymous_id and user_id. The first is device specific and generated by the Rudder SDK, the second is the user identifier that can be assigned by application code depending on a userâ€™s registration or login. 

Typically a user would login to an application at least once while using the application on a particular device. The user_id should then become available and be included in event messages. Below code creates a unique identifier dbt_visitor_id that links the user_id to the anonymous_id. The analytic function first_value has been used here
