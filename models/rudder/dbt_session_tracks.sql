/*

A decision is made to treat two events, for the same user, that are separated by 30 minutes or more - as belonging to two different user sessions. The choice of 30 minutes is arbitrary and can be modified as per requirements. Sequence number is assigned to each event within a particular session. Also, the timestamp for the first event in the session is considered as session start time. Start time of the next session is also calculated.
